## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization

To gain meaningful insights into the sugarcane dataset, we conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process. This helped identify patterns, detect anomalies, and understand the relationships between key variables impacting sugarcane growth and yield.

### âœ… Key Steps in EDA:

1. **Data Overview:**

   * Loaded and inspected the dataset for shape, column types, missing values, and basic statistics.
   * Checked for duplicates and performed necessary data cleaning.

2. **Missing Value Analysis:**

   * Identified columns with null values and applied appropriate imputation methods (mean, median, or removal).

3. **Univariate Analysis:**

   * Visualized individual feature distributions (e.g., rainfall, temperature, soil moisture) using:

     * Histograms
     * Box plots
     * Density plots
   * Detected outliers and data skewness.

4. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:**

   * Explored relationships between features and target variables (e.g., yield or production):

     * Scatter plots
     * Correlation heatmaps
     * Pairplots
   * Identified highly correlated variables.

5. **Categorical Variable Analysis:**

   * Analyzed the impact of categorical variables (e.g., region, season, irrigation type) on yield.
   * Used count plots and bar charts for comparison.

6. **Time-Series Trends (if applicable):**

   * Visualized year-wise trends in sugarcane yield and climatic parameters using line charts.

### ðŸ“Œ Sample Visualizations:

* **Heatmap**: Showed correlation between features like temperature, rainfall, soil pH, and sugarcane yield.
* **Box Plot**: Compared yield distributions across different regions or seasons.
* **Line Chart**: Tracked rainfall and yield changes over time.
* **Scatter Plot**: Analyzed the effect of rainfall and temperature on yield.

### ðŸ§  Insights Gained:

* Positive correlation found between rainfall and sugarcane yield in certain regions.
* Some features like soil pH showed weak correlation with yield, suggesting less predictive value.
* Seasonal trends and irrigation types significantly impacted productivity.
